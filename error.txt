Failed to compile

./app/page.tsx
'client-only' cannot be imported from a Server Component module. It should only be used from a Client Component.

The error was caused by using 'styled-jsx' in './app/page.tsx'. It only works in a Client Component but none of its parents are marked with "use client", so they're Server Components by default.

Import trace for requested module:
./app/page.tsx
